An open-source continuation of Minecraft Note Block Studio with exciting new features!
</p>

### Download
You can download Open Note Block Studio [here](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/releases/latest)! _(Windows-only. Support for other platforms is coming soon!)_

### Project Status
The current version is considered stable and feature-complete; as such, it's no longer accepting contributions or new features other than minor bug fixes.

In order to future-proof the project and allow us to make further improvements, we're currently in the process of rewriting the program using the Qt framework. You can read more about this and our future plans regarding the project in [this discussion](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/discussions/426)!

### Issues
To report issues, please head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/issues) page.
You can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/w35BqQp) to get support and share your creations!

### Contributions
This project is written in GameMaker Language (GML). You must have [GameMaker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/) in order to open the project and make changes.

Since OpenNBS relies on 32-bit DLLs, you must use GameMaker runtime version **2022.6** as 32-bit support was removed in further versions. Scroll down [this page](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html) and click _'Older versions'_ to find the appropriate installer.

If you'd like to contribute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/issues/new/choose) before making a pull request!
